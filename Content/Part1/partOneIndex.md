# Part 1 - Getting Started with Azure

## Introduction
In the first part of the training, we will cover some fundamentals to ensure you understand how the cloud platform works and the dependencies between different components. We will also discuss identity, which in the case of Azure is very tightly coupled, and explore various options for managing your public cloud landscape. If you already have some Azure experience, you might be tempted to skip a section that claims to be covering the fundamentals. Still, I encourage you to read along - even if you know most of what I'm about to explain, the few missing parts might be of great value to you.
