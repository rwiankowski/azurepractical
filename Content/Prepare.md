# How to Prepare

This course does not require any specific preparation. All you need is a computer connected to the Internet that runs a browser and allows you to install new applications (if you don't have them yet).

While it is theoretically possible to follow along with a browser alone, to get the whole experience, a code editor like VS Code will be needed.

You do not need to have preexisting access to Microsoft Azure, whether through work, school, or a personal account.

I recommend creating a new Microsoft account dedicated to this training and using the Azure Free tier (though it will require that you provide a Credit Card number). This way, we can start fresh, get full access rights, and have sufficient credits to complete all steps. If you prefer not to create a free account and use access from your work or school, you will likely not be able to perform some exercises from the first part of the course.
