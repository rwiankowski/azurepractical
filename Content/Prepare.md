# How to Prepare

This course does not require any specific preparation. All you need is a computer connected to the Internet that runs a browser and allows you to install new applications (if you don't have them yet).

While it is theoretically possible to follow along with a browser alone, to get the whole experience, a code editor like VS Code will be needed.

You do not need to have pre-existing access to Microsoft Azure, be it through work, school, or a personal account. If you already have access, I strongly encourage you not to use it. I will ask you to create a new Microsoft account dedicated to this training and use the Azure Free tier. This way, we can start fresh, get full access rights, and have sufficient credits to complete all steps.
